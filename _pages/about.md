# About Me
* I am a master student in the Department of Informatics at [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/), advised by [Prof. Matthias Althoff](https://www.in.tum.de/i06/people/prof-dr-ing-matthias-althoff/) of the [Chair of Robotics, Artificial Intelligence and Real-time Systems](https://www.in.tum.de/i06/home/).
* My research interests lie in the perception algorithms for automated driving systems, particularly in visual SLAM and object detection/tracking with LiDAR/RGB-D data, a copy of my master thesis on multi-object tracking can be found [here](https://eysch.github.io/files/YU Boqian - MT.pdf). Advanced knowledge in machine learning and deep learning from both theoretical and practical aspects.
* I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in mechatronics from [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/), Shanghai. My undergraduate research advisor is [Prof. Nan Xie](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/75300001_Nan_Xie).
